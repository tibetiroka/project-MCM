# System Requirements

||Minimum|Recommended|
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
|OS|Linux (64 bit), MacOS, Windows XP (32 bit), Linux AArch64 | Windows 10 64-bit|
|RAM|1GB|4GB|
|Graphics|OpenGL 2.0|OpenGL 4.6|
|Storage space|200 MB|500 MB|

(Please note that the actual requirements will depend on your OS. The game generally doesn't use more than 700 MB RAM at any time, but if your OS takes up a lot of the available memory you might need 4GB to actually have enough for the game. The OpenGL version is just an estimation, you will probably be able to run the game on older systems at the cost of performance. The storage space used also depends on the file system of your OS, and it keeps changing as we are adding more and more assets to the game.)

# Installing

Official releases are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/DartProductions/project-MCM/releases), and we are planning to take this game to other platforms as well.

### Installing from GitHub

#### **Via the McLeodMassacre.zip file**

1. Go to the [releases](https://github.com/DartProductions/project-MCM/releases), and choose the version you want to install. We recommend to use the latest stable release.

2. Download the file and extract it to any location on your machine.

3. Run the appropriate launcher file depending on your operating system:
  
    - For Windows systems (both 32 and 64 bits), use the `run.bat` or `run.exe` files.
    
    - For 64-bit Linux systems, use the `run-linux64` file.
   
    - For AArch64 Linux systems, use the `run-linux-aarch64` file.
    
    - For MacOS systems, use the `run-macos` file.

    You can probably run the game on other operating systems as well, but they are not supported and the game isn't guaranteed to work properly on them. 

#### **Via unzipped release files**

1. Go to the [releases](https://github.com/DartProductions/project-MCM/releases), and choose the version you want to install. We recommend to use the latest stable release.

2. Check your Java version by running the command `java -version` in your console/command line. You can skip this option if you are unsure how to do this.

3. If you don't have the latest version (Java 16), please install it. **This game requires Java to run.** 

    - Download official releases from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk16-downloads.html).
    
    - Alternatively, you can use the java files provided with the release. Make sure you choose the correct version for your operating system (you can download all of the files if you are not sure which one to use). Place the downloaded file(s) in your game installation folder.
    
4. Download the game jar file into your installation folder. It should be named `McLeodMassacre.jar`.

5. Double-click the jar file. If the game launches, you have finished the installation.

6. If the game doesn't launch, you might need to use a launcher file specific to your operating system. Download the launcher file into your game installation folder.
  
    - For Windows systems (both 32 and 64 bits), download the `run.bat` or `run.exe` files.
    
    - For 64-bit Linux systems, download the `run-linux64` file.
    
    - For AArch64 Linux systems, download the `run-linux-aarch64` file.
    
    - For MacOS systems, download the `run-macos` file.

    If you are unsure, you can download all of the files and try which one launches the game correctly.

#### **Building from source**

You can use IntelliJ IDEA to import the repository as a project, and use the `-Djava.library.path=target/natives/` JVM argument to run it from the IDE, or the `java -Djava.library.path=lib -jar McLeodMassacre.jar` command to run the built jar file.

As a free and open-spource game, McLeod Massacre was created by the fan community, and we are hoping to keep it that way. You are allowed to create your own extensions that can make it into this game after they complete the review process.
